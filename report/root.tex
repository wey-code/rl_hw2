\section{简介}

\section{任务描述与分析}

整体任务为根据输入的车辆周围情况，借助深度强化学习算法得到高层的指令规划。再借助仿真器内部的运动规划器，将高层指令转化为具体的轨迹让底层控制器有效跟踪。

\subsection{仿真环境描述}
整体实验基于$highway\_env$开发，具有较强的灵活性。下面分别针对状态空间、动作空间等进行叙述。
\subsubsection{状态空间}
在环境中，状态空间可以选择底层的低维向量输入，也可以选择高维的图像输入和占用格作为输入。下面重点叙述使用低维向量输入和图片输入的基本情况。

当使用低维输入时，传入最近15辆车的坐标、速度、倾斜角度等信息表示出来，包括$x,y,vx,vy,cos_h,sin_h$。传入一个大小为$[15,7]$的数组。方便后面网络进行处理，其中第一行表示的是本车的未知
